## 2026-04-06 — refactor: rename mode slugs — recruiter → professional, coworker → peer (PR #76, closes #77)

- `MODES` list in `base.py`: `["professional", "peer", "buddy"]`
- Email label map, all docstring slug references updated backend-wide
- `chat/page.tsx`: `MODE_LABELS`, `MODE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `CANONICAL_MODE_ORDER`
- `admin/page.tsx`: `ALL_MODES`, `MODE_LABELS`, all state keys, `PROMPT_PLACEHOLDERS`, default tab
- Alembic migration 004: `UPDATE mode_configs`, `chat_messages`, `invitations` (including `array_replace` on `allowed_modes` array) — auto-runs at startup
- Overlay files renamed: `professional.md`, `peer.md`; old `recruiter.md`, `coworker.md` + `.example` files deleted
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `README.md` updated — historical decision log entries left intact
- Dark mode palette tweak also shipped in PR #71 — lighter surfaces, borders, secondary text
- PR #76 merged — branch: refactor/mode-naming

## 2026-04-06 — refactor: rename recruiter → visitor throughout; absorb session + ordering fixes (PR #75)

- JWT role `"recruiter"` → `"visitor"` in `create_token` and `get_current_visitor` dependency
- `get_current_recruiter` → `get_current_visitor` in `dependencies.py`; `required_role` check updated
- `AcceptInviteResponse.recruiter_id` → `visitor_id` in `models/auth.py`
- `Invitation.recruiter_id` → `visitor_id`, `ChatMessage.recruiter_id` → `visitor_id` in `db/models.py`
- All route params and logger calls updated to `visitor` / `visitor_id` in `auth.py` and `chat.py`
- Alembic migration 003 — renames `recruiter_id` → `visitor_id` in `invitations` and `chat_messages` tables
- Frontend localStorage keys: `recruiter_token` → `visitor_token`, `recruiter_id` → `visitor_id`
- Absorbs all of PR #73: sessionStorage → localStorage (cross-tab persistence), +1ms timestamp on assistant message (deterministic chat ORDER BY), TL;DR label on expandable responses
- Buddy overlay final rewrite: ~110 lines, unstructured, comedian anchors, expletive list, "pick one thing and commit" anti-glaze rule
- System prompt updated: "Lead with the point on long answers" rule added; stale sessionStorage reference fixed
- PR #73 superseded and closed; PR #75 merged — branch: refactor/visitor-naming

## 2026-04-06 — fix: SSL cert verification for DO managed Postgres (PR #64)

- `ssl=True` in asyncpg uses Python default SSL which verifies the server cert chain
- DO managed Postgres uses a private CA not in the system trust store → `SSLCertVerificationError`
- Fix: build `ssl.SSLContext` with `check_hostname=False` and `CERT_NONE` in both `base.py` and `migrations/env.py`
- Connection remains TLS-encrypted; only chain verification is skipped (standard pattern for managed cloud DBs)
- PR #64 merged — branch: fix/ssl-cert-verification

---

## 2026-04-06 — feat: chat persist logging + admin db-status endpoint (PR #63)

- `logger.info` after `db.commit()` in chat endpoint — confirms writes in DO Runtime Logs
- `GET /api/admin/db-status` returns row counts for all 3 tables + Alembic version (admin-protected)
- Diagnostic tool to confirm schema state and whether chat messages are landing
- PR #63 merged — branch: feat/backend-db-diagnostics

---

## 2026-04-06 — fix: surface history fetch errors + empty-mode filter (PR #62)

- Silent `.catch(() => {})` was masking all server errors on `GET /api/chat/history`
- Added `historyError` state + dismissible amber warning banner in message area
- Mode filter fallback: if `active_mode` is empty string, show all history instead of filtering to nothing
- Root cause of "no history on reload" was cross-browser testing (Chrome vs Firefox have separate sessionStorage)
- PR #62 merged — branch: fix/history-not-loading

---

## 2026-04-06 — feat: chat history displayed on page load (PR #60)

- `GET /api/chat/history` fetched on mount, pre-populates message thread keyed to recruiter JWT
- `allHistory` state stores full cross-mode history; `messages` filtered by `activeMode`
- Mode switch restores persisted history for the new mode instead of clearing to empty
- `historyLoading` gates empty state and suggested prompts during fetch
- PR #60 merged — branch: feat/chat-history-frontend

---

## 2026-04-06 — fix: strip sslmode from Alembic migrations env (PR #61)

- `migrations/env.py` built its own SQLAlchemy engine independently — was not inheriting the SSL fix from `base.py`
- `_get_url()` updated to return `(url, connect_args)` tuple; strips `sslmode=require` and passes `ssl=True`
- Alembic migrations now connect successfully to DO managed Postgres
- PR #61 merged — branch: fix/alembic-ssl

---

## 2026-04-06 — chore: gitleaks secret scanning + authoritative .env.example (PR #58)

- `.gitleaks.toml` created — extends default ruleset, allowlists placeholder patterns
- `.husky/pre-commit` rewritten to run `gitleaks protect --staged` with explicit binary path checks
- `.env.example` rewritten as authoritative reference with all credential-shaped values as `xxxx`
- `docker-compose.yml` cleaned — no inline credential defaults
- Full history squash to purge any prior commits with real-looking secrets
- PR #58 merged — branch: fix/secret-scanning

---

## 2026-04-06 — feat: PostgreSQL + pgvector persistence (PR #56, closes #55)

- Replaced all in-memory `app.state` stores with async SQLAlchemy + asyncpg + Alembic
- `backend/app/db/` — async engine, session factory, Base, ORM models (Invitation, ModeConfig, ChatMessage)
- `backend/migrations/` — Alembic async env + initial migration (3 tables + pgvector extension)
- lifespan handler runs `alembic upgrade head` + seeds mode_config via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Invite create/accept fully DB-backed; accept is idempotent (reuses existing recruiter_id)
- Mode config reads/writes to DB; both chat turns persisted; new `GET /api/chat/history` endpoint
- `docker-compose.yml` — pgvector/pgvector:pg16 service with healthcheck + depends_on: service_healthy
- `.do/app.yaml` — managed Postgres 16 cluster, region `sfo`, `DATABASE_URL: ${db.DATABASE_URL}`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — managed Postgres setup steps, updated env table, updated limitations
- `.env.example` — DATABASE_URL documented with scheme notes
- Verified in-container: migrations clean, all 3 tables present, full invite + chat flow persists

---

## 2026-04-06 — chore: post-merge housekeeping + Next.js CVE patch (PRs #52, #53, #54)

- PR #52: post-merge docs after PR #51 (PROGRESS.md, CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.md)
- PR #53: GitHub issue #55 filed for PostgreSQL persistence
- PR #54: Next.js patched from 15.3.0 → 15.3.2 (CVE fix, stable 15.x)

---

## 2026-04-05 — fix: chat header pill and CTA alignment on mobile (PR #51)

- Mode pills, "I am a…" label, and Exit CTA were wrapping to a right-aligned second line on narrow viewports
- Fixed by replacing `flex-wrap justify-between` header with `flex-col` on mobile / `sm:flex-row sm:justify-between` on desktop
- Controls row uses `flex-row items-center justify-between` on mobile — pills left, Exit right on one line
- 6-line CSS-only change, no logic touched — confirmed no regressions
- Issue #50, PR #51, merged same session

---

## 2026-04-05 — feat: v4 UI polish — animations, responsive layout, styled chat, admin improvements (PR #49)

- Custom Tailwind keyframes: `fadeIn`, `fadeInUp`, `slideDown`, `scaleIn`, `typingDot`
- `html`/`body` `h-full` + `flex-col` scaffold → chat page fills full viewport, no fixed height
- Glassmorphism nav: `backdrop-blur-md bg-zinc-950/80`, `usePathname` active link highlight, mobile hamburger with `animate-slide-down` dropdown
- Hero: radial glow gradient (indigo + violet), staggered `animate-fade-in-up` entrance, responsive `text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`
- Chat: user bubbles `bg-zinc-100 text-zinc-900` / assistant `bg-zinc-800/80` with border, animated three-dot typing indicator, per-mode suggested prompts, message area + input dim/lock behind mode-switch dialog
- Admin: `SectionHeader` + `Card` shared primitives; allowed modes auto-check and lock when only one globally enabled; default mode auto-set and disabled when ≤1 mode; per-mode `PROMPT_PLACEHOLDERS`
- Invite + invite-required: centered card layout, CSS spinner, error icon
- Worktree footgun caught and fixed mid-PR — logged in ERRORS.md, NEW_TASK_WORKFLOW.md step 0, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` hard rule #11
- Issue #48, PR #49, merged

---

## 2026-04-04 — feat: chat UX improvements — exit, suggested prompts, mode descriptions (PR #46)

- Exit button in chat header: sessionStorage.clear() → redirect to /
- Suggested prompt chips in chat empty state (admin-configurable per mode)
- "I am a…" label above mode pill selector
- Mode description in switch confirmation dialog
- New GET /api/chat/prompts endpoint (filtered to recruiter allowed_modes)
- Admin overlay editor extended with per-mode prompts textarea

---

## 2026-04-04 — feat: invite modes with per-mode overlays, admin controls, chat UI (PR #42)

- 3 modes: recruiter, coworker, buddy
- JWT carries allowed_modes, default_mode, can_switch_modes
- Backend composes base prompt + mode overlay + mode lock on every /api/chat request
- Admin: invite form with mode config, global toggles, overlay editor
- Chat: mode badge, pill selector, switching starts new conversation
- Fix: modesConfig lifted to AdminControls so invite form reflects global toggles in real-time

---

## 2026-04-04 — fix: frontend/public missing in CI (PR #38)

- frontend/public/.gitkeep added — empty dir not tracked by git, causing Dockerfile.prod COPY to fail
- Logged in ERRORS.md

## 2026-04-04 — fix: useSearchParams Suspense on /invite page (PR #36)

- next build fails in standalone mode without Suspense boundary on useSearchParams
- Split InviteFlow into inner component, wrapped in Suspense in page export
- Logged in ERRORS.md

## 2026-04-04 — v3-PR2: DO App Platform deployment pipeline (PR #34)

- GitHub Actions: push to main → build prod images → push to GHCR → trigger DO deploy
- backend/Dockerfile.prod, frontend/Dockerfile.prod (multi-stage, standalone)
- .do/app.yaml app spec, next.config.ts output: standalone
- load_system_prompt() checks SYSTEM_PROMPT env var first (production path)
- docs/DEPLOYMENT.md created, ARCHITECTURE.md updated
- LaudBot live at laudbot-ij4cd.ondigitalocean.app + laudbot.laudtetteh.io (DNS pending)

---

## 2026-04-04 — agentic system: POST_MERGE_WORKFLOW + CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT fixes

- PR #32 merged — branch: feat/admin-invite-ui

---

## 2026-04-04 — v3-PR1: admin invite UI

- InviteSection component added to frontend/app/admin/page.tsx
- Email + optional note input → POST /api/admin/invitations with admin JWT
- Success: invite URL displayed with copy-to-clipboard button

- PR open — branch: feat/admin-invite-ui

---

## 2026-04-04 — v2-PR6: JWT auth for admin and recruiter invite flow

- backend/app/core/security.py: create_token, decode_token, hash_password, verify_password (PyJWT + passlib/bcrypt)
- backend/app/core/dependencies.py: get_current_admin, get_current_recruiter FastAPI deps
- Admin login: POST /api/auth/admin/login → JWT (role: admin)
- Invite flow: POST /api/admin/invitations (admin-JWT-guarded) → invite URL; POST /api/auth/accept-invite → recruiter JWT with recruiter_id
- Role separation: admin JWT rejected on /api/chat (403); recruiter JWT rejected on /api/admin/* (403)
- Recruiter JWT carries recruiter_id for future chat history keying — no refactor needed when persistence lands
- Frontend: /admin shows login gate; /invite exchanges token param → recruiter JWT → redirect /chat; /chat requires Bearer token, redirects to /invite-required if missing
- All 8 test paths passed manually
- PR #29 open — branch: feat/auth

---

---

## 2026-04-04 — v2-PR4: system prompt from data/approved/

- prompt.py: load_system_prompt() reads /data/approved/system_prompt.md, falls back to stub
- chat.py: calls load_system_prompt() per request instead of inline constant
- docker-compose: ./data:/data mounted on backend service
- system_prompt.md.example committed as template; copy + fill in to activate LaudBot
- SOURCES.md + .env.example updated with convention and override docs
